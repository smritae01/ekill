ekill
=============

It's like [**xkill**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xkill), but for annoying web pages instead.

ekill is basically a Chrome plugin that quickly gets rid of unnecessary elements on a web page.

The link to the plugin on the [chrome
web-store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ekill/lcgdpfaiipaelnpepigdafiogebaeedg?hl=en).
